# Backend example with Node.js

[![Node.js
CI](https://github.com/veikkos/react-fullstack-backend/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/veikkos/react-fullstack-backend/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)

This backend works together with [React frontend
example](https://github.com/veikkos/react-fullstack-frontend).

## Usage

You need to create [MongoDB cluster](https://www.mongodb.com/) and
provide your MongoDB URI (`<YOUR_MONGODB_URI>`) in-place at `.env`

Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

Start backend
```
npm start
```

Backend is started to port 3001. You can test it with
browser. Following address should initially return empty list.
```
http://localhost:3001/address`
```

You can see all requests printed for easier debugging:
```
GET /address
Body: {}

POST /address
Body: { name: 'Veikko', address: 'Mannerheimintie', developer: true }
```

## Tests

Backend is tested with mocked MongoDB using
[mongodb-memory-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb-memory-server). Tests
can be executed with
```
npm test
```

### API

Supports GET/POST/DELETE operations for `/address` API. Backend does
not have its own persistent storage or cache but MongoDB is used.

Example of autogenerated documentation can be generated with `npm run
doc`.
